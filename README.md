# Anomaly Psy Tweaks
Version: 1.1.1

[Steam Workshop Page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3521723260)

 A collection of tweaks to the psychic anomalies in RimWorld designed scale their effects based on pawns' psychic sensitivity. This mod aims to make psychically deaf and dull pawns more valuable when dealing with psychic anomalies, while also making psychically sensitive and hypersensitive pawns more vulnerable to said anomalies. Effects and vulnerabilities added by this mod can also be enabled and disabled in the mod options as you see fit.
## Changes to Anomaly Interactions:

 - **Revenant:**
	 - **Psychically deaf pawns:** can be targeted by the revenant but they cannot be hypnotized.
	 - **Psychically dull pawns:** can be targeted by the revenant, but it gives them a less severe consciousness penalty that will not incapacitate them on its own.
	 - **Psychically sensitive pawns:** receive a more severe form of hypnosis with effects that linger for a day or two after the revenant is killed.
	 - **Psychically hypersensitive pawns:** receive an even more severe form of hypnosis with effects that linger for several days after the revenant is killed.
 - **Unnatural Corpse:**
	 - **Psychically deaf pawns:** by default, cannot be selected as the Unnatural Corpse's target. If you enable "Unnatural Corpse can crush psychically deaf pawns' heads" in the mod settings, the Unnatural Corpse will be able to target psychically deaf pawns, but it will kill them by crushing their skull in stead of destroying their brain. 
 - **Golden Cube:**
	 - **Psychically deaf pawns:** cannot be selected as Cube's initial target and cannot become enthralled by the Cube.
	 - **Psychically dull pawns:** can be enthralled by the Cube, but it generally takes longer than normal for them to become obsessed with the cube. 
 	 - **Psychically sensitive pawns:** can be enthralled by the Cube, and they generally become obsessed with the Cube faster than normal pawns.
	 - **Psychically hypersensitive pawns:** can be enthralled by the Cube, and they generally become obsessed with the Cube much faster than normal pawns. 
 - **Creepjoiner Agony Pulse:**
	 - **Psychically deaf pawns:** are not affected by agony pulses.
	 - **Psychically dull pawns:** are affected by agony pulses, but the pain is not severe enough to down them on its own.
 	 - **Psychically sensitive pawns:** take slightly longer than normal to recover from the initial pulse and experience even more lingering pain than normal.
	 - **Psychically hypersensitive pawns:** take significantly longer than normal to recover from the initial pulse and experience significant lingering pain.
## Q&A:
 - **Q: What happens if all my pawns are psychically deaf?** 
	 - A: By default, the Golden Cube quest and Unnatural Corpse quests will not trigger if there are no psychically sensitive pawns on the map. Revenants can still spawn and creepjoiners can still release agony pulses, but they wont actually be able to harm to your colonists.
 - **Q: Is this safe to add mid save?**
	 - A: It is safe to add mid save, but changes may not effect events currently in progress.
 - **Q: What happens if I change the mod settings while one of the modified events is happening?**
	 - A:  Effects from the mod will not be cleared automatically, but they should still go away on their own over time and/or when an anomaly is neutralized.
 - **Q: What about the Nociosphere?**
	 - The Nociosphere's pain effects already scale based on psychic sensitivity in vanilla, so I left it alone.
 -  **Q: CE???**
	 - A: No idea. I'm waiting for a stable 1.6 release before I do any testing.

## Potential Compatibility Issues:
This mod makes significant changes to the code used for the anomalies listed above, so there is a high likelihood that it will conflict with other mods that affect those anomalies' target selection and/or ongoing effects.

Please let me know if you find any unexpected conflicts. I will try to fix the ones I can.

## Latest changes:
Version 1.1: added an option that enables the Unnatural Corpse to target psychically deaf pawns and kill them by crushing their skull. It is disabled by default, but can be turned on in the mod settings
